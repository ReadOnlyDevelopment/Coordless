# Coordless
 
Cordless is a very simple mod that only has one task and one task only. Remove the players location out that is written to crash-logs. 

 

Coordless is mainly targeted at PVP style servers where the disclosure of a players location could put their hard work, countless hours and valuable possessions in jeopardy.

All from the simple act of posting a crash-log to a channel, without realizing what they have just done.

 

What this does, is stop other players from preying on other others by taking advantage of server support channels mainly in discord by grabbing the location from the logs 

the victim uploaded and having free rein to their location, and possibly others location where they also  could have their location logged simply due to proximity.
